Create the best, in the simplest possible way you can find, it is a tool for everyone.

Basic is a tool for new web developers who just started web development, when I started web development I often get scared and thought of quitting because of how hard it was to setup and configure a project from scratch without knowing anything. I made this tool by using other portable open-source tools which were available to me

**To get started run this command in the terminal**

    npx degit Alphine-dev/Basic your-project-name
this should install a folder with a given name, now cd into the folder and then run

	npm install

 this will install all the necessary dependencies in the folder, then run the following command
 
	npm run dev

this will start the development server on  **port**  [3000].

>note all files ending with [".scss", ".sass", ".less" --- etc]
>will be compailed automatically by vite.
